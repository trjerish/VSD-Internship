## Task 1
### C Code implementation in Leafpad
In this section, we'll explore how C code is reprsented in the instruction set of the RISC-V tool. We'll start by testing the GCC compiler with a simple program that counts the sum of numbers from 1 to n. STEP 1: Write the C program that counts the sum of numbers from 1 to n in the Leafpad editor(open source graphical text editor) and save the code.
### Command
     1. Initially the cd command is given in the terminal.
     2. After which the leafpad _filename_ & is given which is the command for opening the leafpad.
     3. Now the leafpad is opened in which the required code for the title is typed respectively.
